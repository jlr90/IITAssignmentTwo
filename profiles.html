          <p>
            In reference to personality tests taken by each of the group members, there is a high proportion of natural
            leaders in the group. Instead of being a point of conflict however, the subtle differences in style and
            approach between the team members complement one another. Some members are able to excel in areas where
            others may find difficulties.
          </p>
          <p>
            All members are ‘team players’, in that they are easy-going, friendly and most importantly, supportive.
            Everyone is able to organise themselves effectively and communicate their intentions and ideas to the group.
            This ensures nobody falls behind and everyone can be confident in each other’s ability to handle the
            workload.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the test results, Helen and John both approach tasks logically and analytically. This is
            balanced by Ben’s results which indicate he approaches tasks with more creativity and can think about things
            in a more abstract sense. Both Andrew and Sam are adept at noticing problems when they arise and coming up
            with solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            An important consideration in any group is not just how the individual member’s skills complement one
            another, but in how the group operates as a cohesive unit. Sam, Andrew and John all display traits of
            calmness and cooperativeness in their Big-Five Personality tests. Combined with Ben’s skills in
            understanding and communication, and Helen’s skills in motivation and communication, the five group members
            are easily able to work with one another and avoid any conflict. This enables the group as a whole to avoid
            any pitfalls that might be common in group assignment situations. Some of these may include; one or more
            members falling behind in their work, or a clash of ideas between stubborn, leader type personalities.
          </p>
          <p>
            No particular member is a standout at detail-oriented tasks; however, this is also not necessarily a
            weakness for any member either. Given the strong communication and understanding between members, the group
            members are able and ready to assist one another where necessary.

                Hello! My name is Helen. I am 45 and live in Perth Western Australia. I run my own business in the Aged
                Care Sector called Compatible Care Nursing Services. I love working - my job is extremely fulfilling. I
                have a husband, two kids who are 10 (Girl) & 7 (Boy) that are my world. My present hobbies are running
                after my two kids. I also attend dance and musical theatre classes as I love to dance and sing. I have a
                passion for IT software and want to learn to create my own programs. I have no formal education in IT
                but a lot of on the job experience.

                Helen’s high score on the leadership test make her a strong candidate to be the group leader. In the
                context of a group project, task management and team member organisation are critical to a successful
                outcome. A particularly high score in ‘Motivating’ is ideal for ensuring the team is consistently
                working towards the goal.
                <br>
                Being a natural problem solver and decision maker will allow Helen to shine when unforeseen problems
                inevitably present themselves. She will be able to help the team get back on track quickly and
                efficiently.

                  "I really enjoyed collaborating with GS technologies on this assignment. We all worked so well
                  together and it was encouraging to watch everyone help each other with their skill sets. It was like
                  working on a paid project with each person playing their role and utilising their strengths. Andrew
                  was always willing to do what he could with the content and setting up systems, Ben is a natural
                  leader who happily helps to steer the ship, Johnny is a workhorse, he just handled things! So much
                  work was done in the backend by this man and Sam was so well rounded in his ability to help
                  everywhere. I was surprised at how well we all worked together in what I thought was going to be a
                  stressful event.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I think we could have improved on our editing of content. We could have formed a little more structure
                  around how and who was doing what but this said, we all worked so consistently well together that no
                  one got offended if someone made suggestions or crossed over to work that had already been done.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We had a late starter in Chris, but he came in and we just easily redistributed roles. Unfortunately
                  he had to leave the group and again the redistribution of roles was seamless so no real effect was had
                  from this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  No one made anyone feel like a useless part of the team and I can honestly say I am so proud of what
                  we have achieved from different locations of Australia and feel honoured to have worked with these
                  men. I hope to collaborate with them again in the future.

                Hello! My name is Ben, I’m from Perth. I’m a gamer and a musician, and love learning
                about all sorts of new things, especially in the realms of movement
                (parkour, martial arts), philosophy, music, psychology and now, all things IT.
                I love exploring the world around us, and so exploring this digital age and how
                we interact with it is right up my alley. I’m fairly fresh to the field of IT,
                but have had a little experience with HTML and CSS, and have helped to manage and
                maintain wordpress websites.

                  "Working with Group 7 has been, for the most part, an unexpected delight. There has been a theme of
                  helpfulness and everybody is keen to do their bit. A wide range of skill sets from the members has
                  been hugely beneficial. Andew and Helen jumped in early on to set up some of the things we'd need to
                  work effectively (Discord channel for communications, Smartsheets for interactive checklists to allow
                  for a clear overview of what needs to happen and who's assigned to the tasks). John, with his
                  experience of HTML/CSS/front end coding and GitHub, has been able to take the lead on website design,
                  and has been assisting us with how to approach both. Sam had the time to leap straight into the
                  assignment content.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The team overall has been very responsive and helpful where required. Everyone is keen to work
                  together, and everyone's want to do well by the assignment and by each other has been lovely. In the
                  lead up to the assessment deadline, we had agreed to split the workload contributions percentage
                  evenly. I’d suggested the idea as it was a simple way of acknowledging that we’d all been
                  contributing, and I felt it would be good for a sense of comradery and trust for the group going
                  forward. I noticed that shortly after this was decided, the due diligence and attention to detail in
                  the preparation of certain tasks dropped significantly. The drive for some members to see their tasks
                  through to polished completion waned. I am not sure this is a cause and effect (if certain members
                  felt they no longer needed to maintain quality, trusting they would now receive similar assignment
                  marks regardless of their input), or if this should be attributed toward something else (perhaps
                  burnout coming toward the end of a project). Either way, I did notice a last minute dip in quality and
                  a disinterest in following through on fine-tuning from some group members.

                <p>
                  The group had initially started out with a sixth, Chris Brissett who confirmed on 17/7/20 that he
                  would no longer be able to continue with this project. Chris had become unresponsive during the course
                  of the project, but eventually did get in touch to let us know that he was no longer able to continue
                  with the task. Because the rest of the team has been working diligently and cohesively, Chris' absence
                  has thankfully not made a strong impact on the effectiveness of the team.

                Hi my name is Andrew. I am 26 years old and live in West Gippsland, Victoria. I enjoy catching up with
                friends over a drink in the city, and travelling within Australia and internationally. I have limited
                experience in IT, but have basic knowledge of SQL, HTML, CSS and using the Adobe Creative Suite
                products. I’m looking forward to learning more about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and
                software development.

                Andrew’s practicality and resourcefulness will ensure he can take on any task in the assignment. Given
                the wide range of content to cover and research to conduct, resourcefulness will be important. He is
                not
                quick to jump to conclusions and can confidently think through situations. His relaxed and easy-going
                personality will ensure he fits comfortably in any group and can help his team members work through

                  "Working with our team was amazing throughout this assignment. While I was originally quite nervous
                  about not finding a team to work with and how this would impact my performance in the unit, my
                  concerns were very quickly eliminated due to the high competency of the team members and our ability
                  to work cohesively, efficiently and harmoniously. All members of our team were in constant
                  communication with each other through our Discord group which was both fantastic to see and allowed us
                  the transparency to track where we were and plan our time accordingly to ensure all tasks were
                  completed. Unfortunately, one member, Chris, did not contribute. That said, I full-heartedly believe
                  that this was more to that team member's detriment, rather than ours as they missed out on the
                  experience we had. It was an amazing introduction to group-based assignments and I can only hope in
                  future when group assignments are again required that I can work with a team as supportive,
                  informative and knowledgeable as this one. I wish them all well in their studies."

                  "Being a part of group 7, or GS Technologies, has been the ideal first group assignment scenario.
                  Everyone has pitched in what they feel is equal amounts, and open communication has been prevalent
                  since day 1. Ben mobilised the group in canvas as soon as it formed, Andrew formed the discord
                  channel, Helen created the smartsheet that tracked the tasks, and John managed the Github side of
                  things. Google docs were used as a way of sharing content and enabling each member to review other
                  members' work. There was a very democratic governance of the group. Although there was no elected
                  leader, each decision was put forward to the group, and voted on formally through polls (set up by
                  Helen), or discussed and decided on in discord. The only thing I would change is the reviewing of each
                  other’s work. I feel it was a little inefficient, as some team members assessed nearly every other
                  team member's work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If I had the time over again, I would implement a buddy system or something similar where each member
                  checks only one or two other team members' work, so the load is spread more evenly. It says something
                  about the dynamics of this team where my only criticism is that some people worked too hard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unfortunately we had a 6th member who came in late and left just before the deadline. This didn't
                  affect the group very much, as we had already divided almost all tasks when Chris joined, and the
                  possibility of only having 5 members had been broached. Great group!

                work as
                a Web Developer.
                I really enjoy the UI/UX design aspect of building websites. I focus on front-end development, so I am
                particularly confident in my JavaScript and CSS skills.
                The IT world is vast, and I am looking forward to exploring other fields such as machine learning and
                robotics.
                In my free time I enjoy playing guitar in a rock band with friends and hitting the golf course on a
                sunny
                day.

                  Andrew was quick to set up a Discord channel for everyone to communicate on. We were in constant

                  meetings. Andrew, Ben and Helen were all quick off the mark to get the team organised. The Discord
                  channel as I mentioned, Google Docs to write out a plan and key points, and a Smartsheet document to
                  track who was doing what task, their progress, and important comments. Sam was quick to take on tasks
                  and used his time well to produce content and help review other member’s content.
                  <br>
                  Everyone was prompt and diligent with updating files on the GitHub repository and communicating
                  progress with the other group members. The only exception was Chris, who was late to join the
                  conversation and then quickly dropped out of communication. This was due to circumstances outside his
