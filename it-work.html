            A key component of our team's research for this assignment was to conduct an interview (via Zoom) with an IT
            Executive to understand the key drivers, public and private impact of the various technologies being
            considered by the group.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Saturday, July 11th, we interviewed with Samantha Gloede, Managing Director with KPMG's Technology Risk
            Management practice, based in New York. Samantha has over 22 years of experience in technology consulting in
            Australia, the United States, and across Asia Pacific and Europe. Samantha provided her perspectives on the
            various types of technology-based careers available across multiple organisations and industries.
          </p>
          <p>
            She discussed the market drivers for key emerging and disruptive technologies including Cognitive
            Technologies (including Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning), Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies, Cloud,
            Internet of Things, and Big Data. She provided some examples of how these technologies are being implemented
            to enable digital disruption and transformation of enterprises. Samantha also discussed the criticality in
            today's world of the cybersecurity function and broader technology risk concepts such as incident response,
            insider threat, data privacy, resilience, supply chain integrity, as well as regulatory and compliance
            requirements.
          </p>

          <h5>Interview</h5>
          <p>
            Post-school, Sam was deciding what she wanted to do, and at the time it was not common to have a business
            degree with a technology degree, so she went to Murdoch University and completed a Commerce Degree with a
            double major in Computer Science and Accounting.
          </p>
          <p>
            After interning a few summers throughout University at KPMG, she soon took on a permanent role. Big
            consultant firms like KPMG were very keen to find people that could understand business as well as
            understand IT. Sam was able to help companies to understand Information Technology and how it can drive a
            business (value add).
          </p>
          <p>
            Nowadays people that work in business have to have a foundational education in technology and Sam mentioned
            that at KPMG and most of their major clients, they don't recruit people now that don't have a technology
            credential of some sort.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sam does technology consulting, and it's focused more on technology risk, Cyber Security and all the other
            risks that exist that technology can either control and manage, or that technology introduces to a business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, technology risk is less about fixing what goes wrong, and more about becoming involved in the
            strategy and design stage of any big project. You have to have an understanding of technology and how to
            implement it in a secure way, with integrity to drive successful business implementation.
          </p>
          <p>
            KPMG is made up of three branches, Financial Audit, Tax and Advisory. Sam works in the Advisory team as a
            Technology Consultant in the Risk Management area. Her team has exposure to all the technology services at
            KPMG inclusive of;
            <ul>
              <li>Help desks dealing with tactical IT issues</li>
              <li>Engineers who connect the hardware and implement it</li>
              <li>Architects designing how that technology fits together and how it supports the business</li>
              <li>Business Strategists that work out the business needs and the technology required for these needs</li>
              <li>Cyber security teams</li>
              <li>Data Scientists who perform the data analytics</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Data is critical in business today. The value from data comes from analysing it and using cognitive
            technology like artificial intelligence and machine learning to run routines in real-time over the data to
            create real insights.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sam’s team participates in data analytics as they need to make sure there is integrity and security in all
            the outputs. Her team make sure unauthorised users don't access the data. There are ethical constraints as
            well when you are looking at algorithms that are run on data. You want to make sure the algorithm is not
            biased around gender, race, religion, geographical location, anything that could be deemed biased.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bias in data is unintentionally common. Algorithms, for the most part, are used in the way they are
            intended. Still, there are some scenarios where "bad actors" can leverage the influence they have to get the
            answers they want to get (in a propaganda type of way) to benefit their business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sam’s team go in with the expectation that algorithms are written and designed for the best-case output for
            the fair and integrity-driven way. There are many examples where it is not done this way, and they are
            easily manipulated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Machine learning is just that, machines learning! They are learning the rhythms, routines, personalities,
            activities and actions of the data they are running on and the people who are using that data. So, in the
            early days, they are not as broad or as accurate in their success as they are in their duration.
          </p>
          <p>
            At KPMG they have created a solution called "AI in control". In its simplest form, this solution analyses
            algorithms to ensure that it has integrity, that it is free from bias, and drives fairness in its output.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sam’s passion in her job was evident. She mentioned how much her role was multifaceted and engaging. It had
            variety and the ability to travel in the position that appealed to her. Another major pro to working in a
            consulting firm is that they are so grounded in brand recognition, trust and business processes. Sam
            mentioned that this is a good option for new recruits in technology as you get really great training and
            foundation upfront. Working for a firm like KPMG speaks a lot on your resume. You have exposure to different
            industries and different functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            E.g. Banking, Health Care, Government and Defence, Energy and Natural Resources. Life Sciences, Consumer and
            Retail, Technology and Media.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sam discussed that they have a massive technology function that supports the work they do in Risk
            Management, which is another area of technology work at KPMG. They have a CISO who manages their Cyber
            security for their company which is essential due to the sensitive information they handle. They have their
            CIO and chief data officer who drive the strategy for their firm globally around hardware and software they
            are going to use, and make decisions on how to support 100,000 people around the globe travelling and
            working remotely.
          </p>
          <p>
            COVID has made this is even harder as more people are working remotely. They needed to redistribute
            resources for people now not working on the local servers, make their remote servers secure and allow their
            staff access to the technology to keep their teams working. Sam’s team also look after this for their
            clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            COVID has caused other issues causing companies like hers to do a lot of pivoting in what they do to ensure
            they only invest in and take solutions to market that their clients are going to need because of COVID.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sam’s team is currently focused on Life Sciences (Medical devices, Diagnostics, Pharmaceuticals) in their
            space there is a lot of things critical right now due to COVID. E.g. Life Sciences organisations are all
            very focused on developing treatments and vaccinations for COVID-19 in an expedited manner. The successful
            development of treatments and vaccinations will help to control the pandemic and save human lives, it will
            allow the economy to open up and recover, and for these reasons the Intellectual Property of this research
            is incredibly valuable. This increases the interest and motivation of cybercriminals, and therefore the
            security of clinical research and the physical safety of the manufacturing process is one of the highest
            priorities for these organisations in the current environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another concern is supply chain. Everyone is very dependent on the supply chain from China, e.g., production
            of materials, the raw ingredients produced. Many popular devices like iPads and iPhones are made in China,
            but there is a lot of political unrest with China at the moment, so countries can’t source where they did in
            the past causing supply issues and price issues. Also, the demand for products not required before like face
            masks, syringes, etc. means countries have had to quickly pivot to figure out how to produce these items and
            materials without being reliant on China.
          </p>
          <p>
            Supply Chain issues have implications across every organisation, and it's not just technology. Still, from a
            technology standpoint, they can help with the resilience of the technology that supports the supply chain
            and help with the security of the supply chain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Technology is the foundation of everything business does!
          </p>
          <p>
            There is just so much need for technology roles in the business sector across all industries.
          </p>
          <p>
            When asked where Sam sees her career moving in the future, she stated "In my career we are more valued now
            than ever before. We are much more strategic now. 10-15 years ago, we did the dull fixing work. Currently we
            are involved a lot earlier in business discussions."
          </p>
          <p>
            KPMG surveyed 1500 CEOs that they worked for, and IT aspects are in the top 5 of their concerns.
          </p>
          <p>
            The expansion of disruptive and emerging technologies are being used more and more by organisations to
            disrupt change and transform the way they operate, so the technologists are becoming much more critical as
            no one else understands what these technologists do and how they can help drive value for the business.
          </p>
          <p>
            If organisations don't automate the processes in how they do things, they will lose money and lose
            customers. These technologies are becoming so important.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sam was so passionate and excited about the world of IT, we at GS Technologies were a little excited along
            with her. She discussed so many ways we could work in this industry, and it was so enjoyable to hear
            industry stories to emphasise the need for technology and people in these roles.
