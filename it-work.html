            A key component of our team's research for this assignment was to conduct an interview with an IT Executive
            to understand the key drivers, and public and private impact of the various technologies being considered by
            the group.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Saturday, July 11th, we interviewed (via Zoom) Samantha “Sam” Gloede, Managing Director with KPMG's
            Technology Risk Management practice, based in New York. Samantha has over 22 years of experience in
            technology consulting in Australia, the United States, and across Asia Pacific and Europe. Samantha provided
            her perspectives on various types of technology-based careers available across multiple organisations and
            industries.
          </p>
          <p>
            She discussed the market drivers for key emerging and disruptive technologies including Cognitive
            Technologies (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning), Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies, The Cloud,
            Internet of Things, and Big Data. She provided some examples of how these technologies are being implemented
            to enable digital disruption and transformation of enterprises. Sam also discussed the criticality in
            today's world of cybersecurity and broader technology risk concepts such as incident response, insider
            threat, data privacy, resilience, supply chain integrity, as well as regulatory and compliance requirements.
          </p>

          <h5>Interview</h5>
          <p>
            Post-school, Sam was deciding what she wanted to do, and at the time it was not common to have a business
            degree with a technology degree, so she went to Murdoch University and completed a Commerce Degree with a
            double major in Computer Science and Accounting.
          </p>
          <p>
            After interning during a few summers throughout University at KPMG, she was able to take on a permanent role
            there. Big consulting firms like KPMG were very keen to find people that could understand both business and
            technology. Sam was able to help companies to understand Information Technology, and how it can drive
            business and value add.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nowadays people that work in business are expected to have a foundational education in technology, and Sam
            mentioned that many large companies do not employ people who lack qualifications or experience in
            technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sam does technology consulting, which focuses her clients toward understanding cyber security and the risks
            that exist that technology can control or manage, or that technology can introduce to a business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, technology risk is less about fixing a problem after it has occurred, and more about strategic,
            preventative measures in the design stage of a project. A business needs to have an understanding of
            technology and how to implement it in a secure way, with integrity to drive successful business
            implementation.
          </p>
          <p>
            KPMG is made up of three branches, Financial Audit, Tax and Advisory. Sam works in the Advisory team as a
            Technology Consultant in the Risk Management area. Her team has exposure to all the technology services at
            KPMG, inclusive of:
            <ul>
              <li>Help desks dealing with tactical IT issues</li>
              <li>Engineers who connect the hardware and implement it</li>
              <li>Architects designing how that technology fits together and how it supports the business</li>
              <li>Business Strategists that work out the business needs and the technology required for these needs</li>
              <li>Cyber security teams</li>
              <li>Data Scientists who perform the data analytics</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Data is critical in business today. The value from data comes from analysing it and using cognitive
            technology like artificial intelligence and machine learning to run routines in real-time over the data to
            create real insights.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sam’s team participates in data analytics as they need to make sure there is integrity and security in all
            of the outputs. Her team ensures that unauthorised users do not access the data. There are ethical
            considerations when handling analysis algorithms that are applied to data. The algorithm should not have
            social biases toward genders, races, religions, geographical locations, and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bias in data is unintentionally common. Algorithms, for the most part, are used in the way they are
            intended. Still, there are some scenarios where "bad actors" can leverage the influence that they have in
            order to skew data analysis results that may benefit their business.
          </p>
          <p>
            When working with clients and the algorithms they use to analyse data, the approach that Sam's team takes is
            to presume that the algorithms are written and designed for the best case output for fairness and integrity.
            However, she maintains that there are many cases where this is not so; algorithms are easily manipulated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Machine learning takes time to reach effectiveness as the algorithms hone their accuracy of understanding
            toward rhythms, routines, personalities, activities and actions of the data they are running, and of the
            people who are using the data. As machine learning is an evolving technology, dated models of machine
            learning that are still in use can present inaccurate or incomplete analysis of data.
          </p>
          <p>
            KPMG has created a solution called "AI in control". This solution applies machine learning to analyse the
            algorithms of other machine learning environments to ensure their integrity and freedom from bias.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sam's passion for her job was evident. She reflected on the multifaceted and engaging nature of her role.
            Variety of work and travel for work were key appeals of the position. Another significant benefit to working
            in a consulting firm is their grounding in brand recognition, trust and business processes. Sam suggests
            that working at such consulting firms is a good option for new recruits in the technology sector, as great
            training is provided helping one to develop their foundations in the field. KPMG is a ‘big four’ global
            consulting firm. Having work experience at such a firm is highly desirable on a resume, and the exposure to
            different parts of the industry is strongly beneficial, such as Banking, Health Care, Government and
            Defence, Energy and Natural Resources. Life Sciences, Consumer and Retail, Technology and Media.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sam discussed how they have a massive technology function that supports the work they do in Risk Management,
            which is another area of technology work at KPMG. They have a CISO who manages their Cyber security for
            their company which is essential due to the sensitive information they handle. They have their CIO and chief
            data officer who drive the strategy for their firm globally around hardware and software they are going to
            use, and make decisions on how to support 100,000 people around the globe travelling and working remotely.
          </p>
          <p>
            COVID has made this even harder as more people are working remotely. They needed to redistribute resources
            for people now not working on the local servers, make their remote servers secure and allow their staff
            access to the technology to keep their teams working. Sam's team also looks after this for their clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            COVID has caused other issues resulting in companies like hers to pivot in what they do to ensure they only
            invest in and take solutions to market that their clients are going to need because of COVID.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sam's team is currently focused on Life Sciences (Medical devices, Diagnostics, Pharmaceuticals) as there
            are a lot of things critical right now in this space due to COVID. Life Sciences organisations are all very
            focused on developing treatments and vaccinations for COVID-19 in an expedited manner. The successful
            development of treatments and vaccinations will help to control the pandemic and save human lives, it will
            allow the economy to open up and recover, and for these reasons the Intellectual Property of this research
            is incredibly valuable. This increases the interest and motivation of cybercriminals, and therefore the
            security of clinical research and the physical safety of the manufacturing process is one of the highest
            priorities for these organisations in the current environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another concern is supply chain. Everyone is very dependent on the supply chain from China (e.g. production
            of materials, the raw ingredients produced). Many popular devices like iPads and iPhones are made in China,
            but there is a lot of political unrest with China at the moment, so countries cannot source from where they
            did in the past. This causes supply issues and price issues. Also, the demand for products not previously in
            such demand (e.g. face masks, syringes) means countries have had to quickly pivot and figure out how to
            produce these items and materials without being reliant on China.
          </p>
          <p>
            Supply Chain issues have implications across every organisation, and it's not just technology. Still, from a
            technology standpoint, they can help with the resilience of the technology that supports the supply chain
            and help with the security of the supply chain. As Sam stated in the interview, “Technology is the
            foundation of everything business does.” There is so much need for technology roles in the business sector
            across all industries.
          </p>
          <p>
            When asked where Sam sees her career moving in the future, she stated "In my career we are more valued now
            than ever before. We are much more strategic now. 10-15 years ago, we did the dull fixing work. Currently we
            are involved a lot earlier in business discussions."
          </p>
          <p>
            KPMG surveyed 1500 CEOs that they worked for, and IT aspects are in the top 5 of their concerns. Disruptive
            and emerging technologies are being used more and more by organisations to create positive business change
            and transform the way they operate, so the technologists are becoming much more critical as no one else
            understands what these technologists do and how they can help drive value for the business. If organisations
            don't automate their processes, they run the risk of lagging behind their competitors, losing money and
            customers. These technologies are becoming so important.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sam was so passionate and excited about the world of IT, we at GS Technologies were a little excited along
            with her. She discussed so many ways we could work in this industry, and it was so enjoyable to hear
            industry stories to emphasise the need for technology and people in these roles.
