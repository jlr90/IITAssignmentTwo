           The Ideal Jobs and required skills as listed by members of GS Technologies were compared against labour insight data sets from Burning Glass Technologies (BG). Comparisons were made between the Ideal Jobs with BG data outlining the demand for similar Job Titles and Occupations.  Upon reflection of the comparisons, curiosities were noticed.
         </p>
         <p>
Strong discrepancies were noticed when comparing GS Technologies’s Ideal Jobs to both the BG data for Top 25 Most In-Demand Job Titles and Top 25 Most In-Demand Occupations.  When compared to the BG Job Titles list, a ‘Developer’ ranked poorly coming in as third least demanded (#23 out of 25 listed). A ‘Software Developer’ was a separate job title in the same data set which also scored poorly at #19. However, when compared to the BG Occupations list a ‘Software Developer’ ranked as the most in-demand position, showing an unintuitive and stark contrast when comparing our Ideal Jobs against the two seemingly related sets of BG data.  
        </p>
         <p>
The industry data displayed by BG was taken from as early as March 2017 and up until March 2018 at the latest (Top Burning Glass Occupations (BGTOCCs), 2018). Because the BG data provided may be outdated, the comparisons below may no longer be an accurate reflection of the demand for GS Technologies’s Ideal Jobs as of 2020.

Group 7 advises that further research into these curiosities would be required in order to get potentially more up-to-date and accurate insights, and suggest that the information below serves merely as a simple introduction to understanding their relation to industry demands rather than a comprehensive and conclusive evaluation.

          <p>
       For the purpose of comparison, a highly demanded job ranking will score highly on the graph, with 25 being the most in demand, and 0 suggesting that the Ideal Job was not listed in the Top 25 BG data.
 </p>
          <p>
When comparing GS Technologies member’s Ideal Jobs to the Burning Glass data for the Top 25 IT Job Titles, GS Technologies member’s employability appears unideal at a glance. Two of the desired positions (Senior UX/UI Designer and Senior Systems Architect) are not present on the  list at all, and the remaining ideal jobs from the team are quite away from the top of the list (Top Titles, 2018).  To get a better understanding of what this really means, we need to examine these findings from a few different angles, and in regard to comparisons with other BG data lists. 
 </p>
          <p>
The lack of demand for a specific job title should not necessarily be mistaken for a lack of employability for those seeking work with the skills required for their Ideal Job. A Full Stack Developer may not be a highly demanded job title according to the BG data, but the skills required to be a Full Stack Developer would allow the job seeker to be desirable for a range of highly demanded job titles. These could include a .Net Developer (Rank #23), Front End Developer (#19), Java Developer (#18) (What is Full Stack Developer? Skills to become a Web Developer, 2020). 
 </p>
          <p>
Similarly, the position of a Senior UX/UI Designer as a job title is not listed in the BG data, but requires the skills of multiple job titles that are. These include the skills of a Front End Developer (#19), Graphic Designer (#24) and Ux Designer (#5) (Costa, 2020). 
 </p>
          <p>
One of the career paths that lead to becoming a Senior Systems Architect is to first have strong experience as a Solutions Architect which ranks at the top of the list at #25 (Hankinson, 2020). Therefore, even though Senior Systems Architect is not listed in the Top 25 In-Demand Job Titles BG data, the skills required to be one suggest a competitive employment advantage in related positions.
 </p>
          <p>
Senior positions and niche positions will often be in less demand, but that should not infer their unimportance as a position (Pearson, 2020).

          <p>
           It is noted that the specific Ideal Jobs “Senior UX/UI designer”, “Senior Front End Developer” and “Senior Systems Architect” are absent from the Occupations list, but “UI / UX Designer”, “Software Developer” and “Computer Systems Architect” are present.  Because experience and seniority are seemingly not used in the Occupations list, the rankings for the occupations UX/UI Designer, Software Developer and Computer Systems Architect were chosen for the comparison in the above graph to represent the Ideal Jobs of Andrew, John and Ben respectively. (Top Burning Glass Occupations (BGTOCCs), 2018)
 </p>
          <p>
When comparing the Ideal Jobs to the BG Top 25 Occupations list, we find astoundingly different results from the BG Top 25 Job Titles list.  According to the Occupations list, the Ideal Jobs are highly in demand. The difference between in-demand 'Job Titles' and their 'Occupations'  counterparts is unintuitive and seemingly paradoxical. 
 </p>
          <p>
A ‘Software Developer’ as a job title is amongst the least desired (#7), but a 'Software Developer' as an occupation is the most desired (#25). To add to the ambiguity of the comparison, ‘Computer Programmer’ on the BG Top 25 Occupations list ranks at #8, quite a way from the top ranking ‘Software Developer’ occupation, despite the terms being synonymous (Brooks, 2019). 
 </p>
          <p>
The labelling of occupations and jobs as listed on the BG data thus seems arbitrarily different at times and leads one to question whether there are other occupations or job titles that are deeply related to those listed (and thus, equally in demand), but are not named as such (and thus, do not make the list). It also beckons an investigation into, and consideration of, semantic differences for employers listing their jobs, and for those seeking employment. A jobseeker searching for a particular key skill may prove fruitless, but searching for the synonyms of that skill could return significantly more promising results.

          The skills required to fulfill the Ideal Jobs of GS Technologies members were collated. Below is a graph showing the comparison of how many of our group members required each of the Top25 Skills as listed on the BG Top IT Skills list (Skills in Greatest Demand (Specialised Skills), 2018).
          </p>
          <p>
There is a diverse range of job interests within our team, and as such, it’s not common to find a skill on the BG IT Skills lists that is not covered by at least one GS Technologies Member.
          </p>
          <p>
There are some IT skills that are in demand that were not explicitly mentioned in the Ideal Job listings, but could be presumed to be required (e.g. knowledge and experience with Microsoft Windows, SAP, Microsoft Office).  It is interesting to note that there is a demand for Microsoft Windows users and Linux users, but that iOS is not mentioned on this skills list (Skills in Greatest Demand (Specialised Skills), 2018).

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>
Below is a graph showing how many of the GS Technologies Ideal Jobs require the skills listed in the BG data for the Demand of Baseline Skills. Similarly to the comparison between GS Technologies Required Skill Set and the Demand for Specialist IT Skills, due to the variety of Ideal Job interests from GS Technologies, every skill in the BG data for the Demand for Baseline Skills has been covered by a GS Technologies member (Skills in Greatest Demand (Baseline Skills), 2018).
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon investigating the BG in-demand skills lists, some interesting inferences and discrepancies have been observed. ‘Building Effective Relationships’ ranks at #22 on the Baseline Skills list (not in demand), whereas it ranks at #8 on the Specialist Skills list (quite in demand). This could suggest that while ‘Building Effective Relationships’ is important across all industries, it is especially so within IT.
          </p>
          <p>
Some skills seem inevitably entwined within IT jobs even if not explicitly stated as required from the Ideal Job listings. Many jobs in IT will require some amount of decision making. For example, if someone was the sole software developer working on a project, only they could make certain decisions when it came to deciding upon programming paradigms and approaches.
          </p>
          <p>
In the Baseline Skills list, ‘Communication Skills’ ranked highly, and by a decent amount more than the next item on the list - ‘Communication Skills’ had nearly three times the demand than Problem Solving. (Skills in Greatest Demand (Baseline Skills), 2018) ‘Writing’ followed shortly behind at rank #4.  However, ‘Articulate’ ranks at a lowly #23 on the list. One might consider articulation to be synonymous with communication despite the BG data presenting the demand for ‘Articulation’ and ‘Communication Skills’ in vastly different places on the list (Articulate | Definition of Articulate by Oxford Dictionary on Lexico.com also meaning of Articulate, 2020). However, when also considering that ‘Writing’ is high up on the list near ‘Communication Skills’, this could infer that there is a stronger demand for written communication skills versus verbal communication skills. Otherwise, perhaps it is simply a matter of semantics, and the considerations of the differences between ‘Communication Skills’, ‘Writing’ and ‘Articulate’ are redundant. More research would be required for clarification.

            Reflections on the Data by GS Technology Members:
          </p>
          <p>
Members of GS Technologies have reflected on comparisons between their ideal jobs and associated skills sets, with the Burning Glass data.
          </p>
          <p>
Ben:
          </p>
          <p>
“The Burning Glass data could suggest that if I was solely focused on becoming a Senior Systems Architect, it could be troublesome to find work as the industry simply does not demand that position.  However, I trust that such positions will become increasingly important in time, so for now I would feel comfortable to maintain a focus on progressing toward the job title while keeping an eye on the data as it evolves over the years. As it will take me quite a few years before I have the required skill set for my ideal job, I have the opportunity to keep an eye on demand trends as I upskill.  Aiming for such a senior position, I trust that it will be a ‘shoot for the moon and you’ll land amongst the stars’ scenario.”
          </p>
          <p>
Helen:
          </p>
          <p>
“Software development is still my ideal job.  Software is where I feel at home.  I understand how to read data, how to use a system to its fullest and how to push it to provide more.  Per the Top Occupations for year 2018 it is still a highly ranked occupation so I feel that this role would be beneficial.  My goal is to create the software packages within my own business so I am very dedicated to developing the skills to be able to develop and maintain software packages. 
          </p>
          <p>
I would suggest that software development has dropped in ranking for the last 365 days in the Top IT jobs as there would have been a need in these higher ranked areas to make software development a viable role.  No use having software if you have no one to service it, to roll out the solution, to see the solution through its transitional stages.  I also believe that this list is ambiguous as many of these roles in one way or another form a part of software development.  Clearly the aspect I need to further investigate would be what platform of software development do I want to specialise in (eg Java, .Net, SQL) 
          </p>
          <p>
SQL is where my interests lie and this is top of the list of IT skills so this would also further enhance my resume if I had the ability to become very strong as a software developer using SQL and Javascript.  
          </p>
          <p>
In regards to the Generic Skills I feel that I have a strong proven background in many of these skills which will only heighten my capabilities”
          </p>
          <p>
Andrew:
          </p>
          <p>
“Becoming a Senior UX/UI Designer would still be my ideal job. While the job title itself is not included in the Top 25 Most In-Demand jobs, many aspects of it are, including Front End Development, Graphic Design and UX Design.
Due to this, I would have great confidence pursuing this as a career without risking ongoing, challenging employment issues. There would be many avenues into this job, all of which interest me.
I would also think it would be unlikely for jobs like this to decrease in demand over time as it has always been an integral job in the process of IT product development. Similarly, I also believe that in contrast, it is not a career path that is going to disappear into obscurity either. Therefore, ongoing employment would not be at risk so I would be comfortable still proceeding with working towards this career as my goal.”
          </p>
          <p>
John:
          </p>
          <p>
“I enjoy working on the Front End side of things and am still aiming to secure a position as a Senior Front End Developer. However, given the results of the Burning Glass data, it seems that Front End skills alone are not as in demand as other related skills.

A logical step from Front End Development is to also build out skills in relevant Back End technologies. SQL and Java rank highly on the list for Specialist IT skills. These can work hand-in-hand with Front End in many projects.

Interpersonal and team/project management skills are also in high demand. These could be considered as necessary for the ‘senior’ positions, as those are not explicitly listed in the Job Titles category. Given the improvement of Machine Learning and AI technologies which are finding ways to replace human developers on many technical tasks, I also believe a greater emphasis will be placed on IT professionals who can interact well with other people.

Moving forward I will put more effort into understanding Back End technologies, and building interpersonal and team skills in order to better align my career goals with the demand trends.”
          </p>
          <p>
Sam:

“The nature of a full stack developer role dictates that expertise across both client and server is needed. As such, although the specific role of full stack developer may rank lowly, the individual skills required are in high demand on their own. 

Further to this, I believe having skills across multiple disciplines would be highly attractive to employers, as if holes appear in their workspaces, I would be able to be deployed quickly, and without the need of training up, or hiring new candidates

 As this is a far away goal for me, not realistically attainable for at least two or three years with constant improvement, I will continue to upskill with confidence that even if the specific role may not be in demand, the skills that make it up will be.”
          </p>
          <p>
In Summary:

As a diverse group, the skills requirements for our Ideal Jobs are generally in close alignment with the top 25 in demand specialist IT and baseline skills.   Members of GS Technologies are not precious about the specific job title they have chosen, as they trust that by developing the skills required to reach their target destination, they will be readily employable in related positions that are equally fulfilling.  The Burning Glass data has been a useful source of reflection, encouraging members of GS Technologies to consider developing specific skills to better their likelihood of employment - Not just within their Ideal Job role, but in the IT industry in general.  This could be to complement the skill set required of their Ideal Job, or it could highlight the demand of a particular skill within their Ideal Job's required skill set.  This could become an important consideration when deciding upon which skills to develop first in order to become employable or in demand sooner.
