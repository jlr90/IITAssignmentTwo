            Autonomous vehicles (AV), sometimes referred to as self driving vehicles, are vehicles that are capable of
            interpreting their surroundings through the use of sensors and making decisions based on those
            interpretations. There are currently six commonly accepted levels of autonomous vehicles ranging from
            completely driver reliant (0), to completely independent (5) (What is an Autonomous Car? – How Self-Driving
            Cars Work | Synopsys, 2020) . Current iterations of self driving cars (Level 2 - see infographic for a
            complete breakdown of the levels) use a combination of video capture, radar, and the most recent
            technological advancement, lidar - however there is contention from Tesla about the necessity of it (Lee,
            2020). The cameras, often set up in stereo to give an accurate depth, are used to detect road signs, traffic
            lights and traffic lanes, while the radar is used to determine distances of the car in relation to other
            objects, such as other road users. Lidar is used as a 360 degree camera, and can give a general sense of the
            shape or an object it detects (Appiah and Bandaru, 2020).
          </p>
          <p>
            Current levels of automation allows for the car to speed up, slow down, and change lanes. The driver of the
            vehicle is still in control, and safety measures and precautions are in place to ensure that the driver is
            monitoring the traffic conditions. These safety conditions are usually sensors in the steering wheel to make
            sure the driver is still in contact with it, and cameras that monitor eye position to ensure the driver is
            paying attention to the road.

            The progress from driver reliant, to fully independent now seemingly hinges on AI and machine learning. A
            driverless car, or a car driving a passenger needs to be able to predict what likely may happen in any given
            scenario. One scenario could be a child on a bike travelling down a footpath, in which humans would
            anticipate the possibility of the child entering traffic and drive accordingly. In this scenario the
            autonomous car needs to be able to identify the child on a bike and distinguish it from say an adult jogging
            in order to drive accordingly. The good news for autonomous vehicles is that, generally speaking, the more
            data that is provided, the more accurate it will become (In Machine Learning, What is Better: More Data or
            better Algorithms - KDnuggets, 2020). Thus, the more the autonomous vehicles are put in increasingly
            different situations, the more adept they will become at anticipating what may happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The impact that autonomous vehicles will have on society as a whole depends on the level of AV technology,
            and where the legislation is up to. Level 3 which still requires a human to be in the driver’s seat, ready
            to take over, will be less disruptive than the level 5 AV which does not require anyone to be in the car.
            Level 3 would have little to no impact on society as it is realistically only improving on current
            technology in cars presently such as cruise control and obstacle avoidance. Level 4 is where things start to
            get interesting. Level 4 introduces technology that no longer requires that drivers be inside the vehicle.
            These AV’s, however, will likely be geofenced and will not be allowed to operate autonomously outside a
            prescribed zone (Waymo’s driverless car: ghost-riding in the backseat of a robot taxi, 2020). The primary
            effects of level 4 will mainly be felt on the transport industry, with no need for drivers within the
            geofence.

          <p>
            If highways are deemed acceptable for AV’s to operate, then trucking companies will no longer need drivers
            to travel interstate, and could simply employ drivers from a central hub on the border of the geofence,
            taking over from the AV system when the vehicle reaches the hub. The trucks could also theoretically operate
            24/7 as with no driver there is no need for rest. Secondary effects could be felt on the housing markets,
            which could see demand for inner city housing diminish due to increased productivity during long commutes
            (The Unintended Consequences of Self-Driving Cars, 2020), and in turn an increase in property prices in
            fringe cities such as Ipswich, Newcastle, and Geelong. Level 5 is the major disruptor. The need to own cars
            would have been greatly diminished. If you want/need a car, you will be able to order a car much like an
            uber, and use it until you no longer require it. There will no longer be delivery drivers, truck drivers and
            virtually any other driving jobs. There is an estimated direct loss of 2.9 million jobs in the US alone (The
            Unintended Consequences of Self-Driving Cars, 2020) once AV’s are widely used. This does not take into
            account people working in car manufacturing and the car insurance industry, which will likely plummet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the positive effects are less accidents, leading to fewer deaths and dramatically reduced toll on
            the economy due to damage, less congested roads leading to overall more efficient vehicles and shorter
            travel times (5 Effects of the Adoption of Autonomous Vehicles | Ohio University, 2020). With a lower cars
            per person ratio, and overall fewer cars on the road, this will have positive impacts on the environment,
            with less production of cars, and more efficient travel time dropping greenhouse gas emissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, the winners as a result of Autonomous Vehicles will be the planet, and big businesses, as profit
            margins increase, while the number of employees shrinks. The losers will be blue collar workers directly
            employed by the transport industry, followed by peripheral employees.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the perspective of a 25-45 year old Australian not tied to the transport industry, the impacts of
            autonomous vehicles at first will be quite minimal. Perhaps there will be a buyers market emerge in the real
            estate sector as the prices between regional, satellite cities and major cities evens out somewhat. Until
            the implementation of level 5 AV’s, one does not see drastic change in the everyday life of a 25-45 year old
            Australian. When level 5 does get introduced, we will see a remarkable decrease in the price of owner/user
            cars, as manufacturers try to compete with the use of the fleets of Av’s tied to apps such as uber. For
            people that work in an office environment, the length of the work day may stay the same but how it is
            measured may change. While the AV is driving a worker in, they would be able to complete tasks that they
            normally would in the office and so, the work day may start at 9am, as he or she is leaving the house.
