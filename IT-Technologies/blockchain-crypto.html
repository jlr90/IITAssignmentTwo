            A blockchain, in its basic form, is a series of time-stamped records that cannot be retroactively altered.
            These records, named ‘blocks’ are decentralised, meaning that they are managed by a collection of computers
            that are not owned by any single entity (Rosic, 2016). Each block is secured and bound to each other, in way
            of a link to the previous block, and encrypted.
          </p>
          <p>
            In short, a “blockchain is a database that is distributed among many computers” (Casey, 2018) and any
            changes to the database “require the consensus of the other computers”.
          </p>
          <p>
            To ensure that nobody can alter the timestamp, which functions as somewhat of an internal audit trail, the
            blockchain makes use of a protection method called Proof of Work (PoW). Proof of Work is a method created to
            ensure that all digital transactions are secure without the need of a third party (Lindsey, 2018). This
            contrasts with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) which requires a link between a server and user for verification
            (Vocell, 2020).
          </p>
          <p>
            The way in which these records can be verified as untampered is through using Public-key Cryptography, also
            called Asymmetric Cryptography. In contrast with symmetric encryption “where any arbitrary series of bytes
            of appropriate length can serve as a key” (Loganathan, 2017), Public-key Cryptography requires specially
            crafted key pairs. These crafted key pairs are referred to as the private key and public key. While the
            public key can be known to anybody, and shared with others, the private key should be known only by you. As
            a public key is generated from a private key, they “are relatively easy to calculate in one direction, and
            are practically impossible to calculate in the opposite direction” (Richard, 2019). Therefore, the owner of
            a private key can “confidently distribute their public key with the knowledge that no one will be able to
            reverse the function”.

          <p>
            Blockchain technology was conceptualised and has been researched and in development for decades but did not
            come into prominence until the emergence of Bitcoin in 2008. This technology is widely considered as useful
            only for use in respect to cryptocurrency, however there are other clear and valuable uses. A use of this
            technology which is far removed from cryptocurrency is the example of its use in preventing voter fraud.
            Just as the timestamped blocks are used to verify transactions with cryptocurrency to prevent fraud, it can
            also be used to deliver an electronic platform for vote-counting that cannot be hacked (Satara, 2017).
          </p>
          <p>
            While there are uses beyond cryptocurrency, as outlined above, they are still not widely used, and the
            technology itself is still somewhat undefined. As stated by Satara, we “are in an exploration stage, far
            from any established or proven solutions”.
          </p>
          <p>
            To date, blockchain has made the biggest impact on the finance sector. That said, it is currently used in
            the supply chain, food safety and health care sectors, to name a few. These are all vital services where
            investment in this emerging technology is widely advantageous. The benefits of this technology are really
            apparent when looking at the health care and life sciences sector. The integration of blockchain technology
            with the supply chain of pharmaceutical companies ensures the integrity and traceability of the products
            being distributed and would prevent counterfeit drugs reaching end users (Singh, 2020). This prevention is,
            again, due to the inability to hack or change the prior records on the blockchain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blockchain technology will likely have an impact on many aspects of our daily life, directly or indirectly
            and possibly without your knowledge. As Blockchain technology “allows peer to peer transactions as people
            can trust each other in the networks” (Griffin, 2017), the need for intermediaries, such as banks for the
            verification of digital transactions, become unnecessary. This does not mean, however, that banks are
            therefore obsolete. It can be argued that while Blockchain is an emerging and disruptive technology, it
            should be viewed as an advancement on current security protocols which offers a promise of transformation of
            both the internet as well as the global economy and our daily lives.

            The established concepts around Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies is largely seen as beneficial in
            developed nations like the United States and Europe. For example, the Australian Stock Exchange is now in
            the process of transitioning from their current CHESS technology to their new distributed ledger technology
            which promises to “provide issuers and end investors with greater control over, and enhanced confidence in,
            their market activities through timely, secure and simplified access to the register of holders (for
            issuers), financial assets (end investors) and associated information” (ASX, 2020). However, there is a huge
            benefit for people in developing nations as well, where access to technology is far more limited, and “where
            the state does not provide a good trust model” (Castor, 2020). The issue faced here though, is that access
            to computers and Wi-Fi is limited, and while they do have access to 3G and smartphones, these devices are
            not currently able to handle downloading an entire blockchain. Therefore, alternative workarounds are
            required.
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest impact likely to affect the day-to-day life of most individuals in the short-term future will be
            the use of Blockchain for funds transfers, both locally and internationally. Currently, our traditional
            financial services providers such as banks are “lagging behind the pace of technology development”
            (Sergeenkov, 2018). Through the elimination of the requirement to have a bank verify a transaction, the
            transfer of funds at point of sale could speed up payments at lower costs than what is currently charged by
            banks. Similarly, use of this technology could reduce operating costs and allow near on real-time
            transactions between vendors, consumers, and financial institutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further to bank settlements, Blockchain can be used for currency exchange to transfer funds internationally
            both cost effective, and in a timely manner. This is a huge advantage that Bitcoin and other
            cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and XRP offers. However, the “transition to Bitcoin payments among banks
            and other established financial institutions is likely to be a slow one” (Lui, 2017) due to the fact the
            technology is still mostly under development, but largely due to the delay in regulators and governments
            adopting digital currencies.
