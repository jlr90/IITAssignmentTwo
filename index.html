            Hello! My name is Ben, I’m from Perth. I’m a gamer and a musician, and love learning
            about all sorts of new things, especially in the realms of movement
            (parkour, martial arts), philosophy, music, psychology and now, all things IT.
            I love exploring the world around us, and so exploring this digital age and how
            we interact with it is right up my alley. I’m fairly fresh to the field of IT,
            but have had a little experience with HTML and CSS, and have helped to manage and
            maintain wordpress websites.

            I really enjoy the UI/UX design aspect of building websites. I focus on front-end development, so I am

            The IT world is vast, and I am looking forward to exploring other fields such as machine learning and

          <h2>GS Technologies: Group Reflection</h2>
        </div>

          <p>
            <em>For individual member's reflections, please refer to the <a href="./profiles.html">Profiles</a>
              section.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, all contributing team members of Group 7 / GS Technologies were hard working and produced good
            quality work. We managed to distribute the tasks and responsibilities required fairly evenly and were able
            to support one and other when other life commitments got in the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            What really assisted with us meeting the required deadlines was our organisation from the start. We began
            discussions through the Discord group chat immediately after the group was formed on Canvas which allowed us
            to work on this over the largest timeframe we could have possibly given ourselves. This allowed us to not
            only produce higher quality work that was not rushed, but also audit what had been produced against what was
            required throughout the assignment.
          </p>
          <p>
            What we could have improved upon was completely scoping out the requirements of all sections of the
            assignment rather than what was seemingly decided on a brief overview. Rather than outlining the exact tasks
            required as outlined in the marking rubric, we seemed to go off the headings in the assessment details which
            did, in the end, skew the volume of tasks assigned to each member slightly differently than what we as a
            team had intended. This was nobody’s fault, but a lesson was learned here for future assignments.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was surprising to hear so close to the end of the assignment that Chris had unfortunately dropped the
            unit. While he had been silent throughout the entirety of the discussions, there was no communication from
            him about the issues he had been facing which ultimately caused him to leave study. We had planned around it
            under the assumption he would not be contributing, roughly about a week prior to receiving confirmation, and
            redistributed tasks Chris had originally put his hand up for.
          </p>
          <p>
            A major lesson we have taken away from working as a group which really assisted us in completing this
            assignment to a high standard was the constant communication. There was not a single day throughout working
            on this that at least two members of the team were in discussions. As we were also using a platform where
            all group members were able to see the discussions, it allowed all members to know what was happening, as
            well as being able to pose a question to the whole group to receive a range of feedback which we could use
            to all improve on our skills and output.
